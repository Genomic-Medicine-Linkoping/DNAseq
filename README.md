## Rules:
- Raw data from matched tumor/normal samples should be stored in different folders but named the same, e.g.:\
  /path_to_normal/256_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz\
  /path_to_tumor/256_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz
- Paths to raw data and reference must be set in the config.json file.
- Fastq filename suffix must be set in the config.json file, e.g.:\
  /path_to_normal/256_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz --> "_R1_001.fastq.gz"\
  /path_to_normal/256_S1_R2_001.fastq.gz --> "_R2_001.fastq.gz"
  
- Raw data should be stored in the same folder
- Paths to raw data and reference must be set in the config.json file
- Fastq filename suffix must be set in the config.json file, e.g.:\
  /path_to_fastq/FR1_S16_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz --> "_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz"\
  /path_to_fastq/FR1_S16_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz --> "_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz"
